Aamir Khan's 3 idiots was a superhit movie back then in 2009. We all loved it, but it seems that the message is still not implemented. Because even today in 2022, the pressure on students to pursue stereotypical degrees like engineering, doctor, etc. is real. A kid has to convince his parents to allow him to do something like becoming a YouTuber, Graphic Designer, Video Editor, etc. But why the situation is like this? Why do we have such strong stereotypes? Watch this video by Dhruv Rathee as he explains the root cause of this unfortunate problem that continues to exist in our society for decades - the education system.

"The Science of Ghosts | Paranormal, Bhoots and Ouija Boards Exposed | Dhruv Rathee","""Do ghosts really exist?"" is probably one of the most debatable questions in this world. While there is a section of people who believe that they do, there is another section who says that all this is just a psychological drama - and this makes the question even more interesting. If ghosts don't exist, what about the experiences of people who actually claim that they've seen ghosts? What about the footage where we have seen ghosts actually shouting? And what about things like the much popular Ouija Board and paranormal experiences that people claim? Watch this video by Dhruv Rathee to find out the answer to all these questions.

The Problem with Bulldozer Justice in India | Dhruv Rathee,"A new way of ""Justice"" is being imposed in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan upon some people, whose houses, which are illegal structures according to the government, are being demolished by Bulldozers. Many people are celebrating this Instant Justice action- but is this something we should be proud of? Is it really something we should keep on doing? Is this even Constitutional? Do all these things fall within the purview of legal procedures? And most importantly, were those structures really illegal? Watch this video where I talk about this new Bulldozer Politics in India.

North Korea Bans Laughing! | Kim Jong Un | Dhruv Rathee,"President and dictator Kim Jong Un has banned laughing, drinking, and even shopping in North Korea for 11 days as a part of mourning on the 10th anniversary of his father Kim Jong-il. People are not even allowed to cry out loud and take bodies to cremation if someone dies during this period. These rules might sound weird and funny to us, but this is a serious concern as the citizens of North Korea are brainwashed to the extent that they do not even know what's right and what's wrong. Watch this video where I explain these rules and why they are a problem in the 21st century.

CDS Bipin Rawat Helicopter Crash | The Real Reason | Dhruv Rathee,"In an unfortunate incident on 8th December, a military helicopter carrying general and cheif of defense staff Bipin rawat, his wife and 12 other passengers crashed near the hills of Coonoor Tamil Nadu. This was a modern Russian made Mi-17V5 model of helicopter which was going from Sunur to Wellington. It is used for advanced operations and also for professional use by Indian prime minister and the Indian president. Many people came up with theories on why this crash might have happened? Was it the bad machinery, pilot error or bad weather? In this video, I explain these theories and conclude which is the most likely one by comparing this with the famous basketball player Kobe Bryant helicopter crash of 2020.

Recently, Twitter made an announcement that their new CEO will be Parag Agarwal. He is an Indian-American, i.e. an American with Indian roots. Parag was born in Ajmer (Rajasthan), he is an alumnus of IIT Bombay. So the news was bound to gather the attention of Indians. Some people congratulated him and expressed happiness, while others said that this is nothing in it to celebrate. It also reignited the topic of brain drain. In this video, I explain the concept of Brain Drain and why it doesn’t make much sense.

"Carryminati, Munawar Faruqui and Kunal Kamra Controversy | Hinduphobia in Comedy | Dhruv Rathee","Recently, many stand-up comedy shows of Munawar Faruqui were cancelled due to alleged jokes on Hindi gods. Kunal Kamra's Bengaluru shows were also cancelled. In a third separate incident, famous YouTuber Carryminati (Ajey Nagar) had to clip a portion of his MeTube video which showed Ramayan characters. The accusations of Anti-Hinduness are growing every day. I explain and analyse this situation and compare it with Akshay Kumar's film and YouTuber Elvish Yadav. In this video, we will see how the whole Hinduphobia drama is simply a political gimmick.

The Problem in Indian Society that No One talks about | Dhruv Rathee,"Classist attitude is deep within us. And it is often seen in the public discourse and culture as well. Sushant Sinha, Times Now anchor insulted Mohammad Zubair by a classist remark of puncture wala. Mani Shankar Aiyar had made fun of Narendra Modi being a chai wala. BJP supporters make fun of Sonia Gandhi calling her a bar dancer. Some sadhu were angry when waiters wore saffrom in Ramayan Express train. There are also many classist jokes on maids. In this video, I talk about this social evil in detail.

The Secret Business Model of Tesla | How Tesla earns Money? | Elon Musk | Dhruv Rathee,"Tesla has become the most valuable car company in the world. It is more valuable than the next 10 car companies like Ford, Toyota, General Motors, Daimler, BMW and others combined. Its share price has increased exponentially to almost 15 times in the last two years as people invested more and more in the company. And yet the market share of Tesla is only around 2%. How is that possible? What profit margin does Tesla earn while selling the model 3, model X, model S and model Y cars? What are the revenue sources and how much money does Tesla actually make and spend on different things? I explain in this video. Also I explain the secret of Elon Musk’s magic behind making Tesla a successful electric car company.

Vir Das Controversy | Was it Insulting India? | Two Indias | Dhruv Rathee,"Indian stand-up comedian Vir Das did a show at the Kennedy Centre in USA. At the end of it, he recited a poem – Two Indias, which was a social commentary about India. Showing a dichotomy – on one side, the greatness of India, its culture, its philosophy, while on the other side, the grim realities of today. Many people said that they got goosebumps listening to this. They thanked Vir Das for speaking the truth, for exposing the grim reality. While there were many others who felt offended. In this video, I break down the logic behind this type of thought.

But why is Belarus doing this? What has Putin and Russia got to do with it? Why is European Union and Poland under pressure regarding this migrant crisis.

"Swami Vivekananda vs Andh Vishwas, Astrology and Cow Worship | Dhruv Rathee","Swami Vivekananda is a well known personality all across India. People deeply admire him however only a very few Indians truly understand his real ideology. In the last video on Swami Vivekananda, there was a cliffhanger that why Swami Vivekananda said - You will be nearer to Heaven through football than through the study of the Gita. If he would have said this today, then reactionary people would have labelled him as anti-Hindu. I explain this along with Swami vivekanada’s views on Hinduism, Beef, Meat eating, Astrology, Superstition (Andh Vishwas) and mystery mongering.

Bangladesh Durga Puja and Singhu Border Case | Dhruv Rathee,"In the last one week, there were two infamous incidents that happened where holy books were allegedly disrespected,  and this was followed by violence. One incident happened at Singhu border where Guru Grant Sahib allegedly disrespected,  and the other in bangladesh where a Quran was allegedly disrespected. This thing is called Sacrilege. In this video, I discuss how people react to Sacrilege and why it is very important to be more tolerant of others criticism and such seeming disrespect of your holy and sacred things.

Why Air India failed? | Case Study of Air India | JRD Tata | Dhruv Rathee,"Believe it or not, Air India used to be one of the best airlines of the world in 1970s, so much so that even Singapore Airlines was inspired from it. Luxury world class travel, the exquisite food and decor used to be its highlights. In this video, I take you through the journey of rise and fall of Air India. How one man’s ambitions and passion kick started this airline during British Raj times. How JRD Tata went far and delivered on his passion. How Jawaharlal Nehru nationalised this airline and why it eventually ended up failing to such an extent that the government was forced to privatise it. This is the story of Air India.

Pandora Papers have shaken the financial world after Panama Papers.

What if Internet Crashes in the Whole World? | Dhruv Rathee,"It’s not possible to cut the internet by cutting a few cables. Yes you can stop it in a few places, but on a large scale internet will not be possible to shut down. That’s the advantage of decentralization of Internet.

In this video, I talk about the history of the Internet, World Wide Web and the slow centralization of the web happening across the world.

Did Mahatma Gandhi try to save Bhagat Singh? | Gandhi Jayanti Special | Dhruv Rathee,"Mahatma Gandhi and Shaheed Bhagat Singh are often considered as a contrasting force to each other in today’s world. One stood for revolutionary acts, while other for peaceful, non-violent movements. But you will be surprised to know the connection between them. Many people think Gandhi made no attempt with Viceroy Irwin to save the life of Bhagat Singh, but what was the truth? In this video, I explain the historical events all the way from Kakori Train incident to Lahore Conspiracy case and the Parliament act of Bhagat Singh and his fellow freedom fighters. How did the trial of Bhagat Singh proceed? What speech did Netaji Subash Chandra Bose give in favor of Bhagat Singh? Know all in this Gandhi Jayanti special video.

What is Quad? । PM Modi in America । Quad vs China । Dhruv Rathee,"Recently PM Modi went to America and met with Joe Biden, a trip which was once again deemed as historic by a certain section of Indian media. This trip was regarding the Quad summit, but what is the quad group? In this video, I explore the history of Quad group. India, US, Japan, Australia came together after 2004 tsunami for rescue effort. Then, former Indian PM met Japanese PM Shinzo Abe in 2006, and then, the idea of a grouping came into force. Nations which conform to an arc of freedom and prosperity. However, the group was deemed to be anti-china, and Australia pulled out after Kevin Rudd became Aussie PM. It was revived in 2017 when there was official level quad meet on sidelines of ASEAN regional forum in Manila. Now, Indian PM Narender Modi went to America for first leader level Quad meet.

How Rwanda became No.1 Country of Africa | Ground Report by Dhruv Rathee,"In the last 25 years, this African country has shown tremendous amount of economic growth and progress in human development indexes. So much so that it is regarded as the Singapore of Africa. This is Rwanda.  But how did Rwanda manage to recover so well and become one of the cleanest countries in the world? In this video, I tell the story of this small African nation. The secret lies not only in strict laws like banning plastic bags but also in the word - Umuganda. In this ground report from Kigali, I explain all this.

The Emergency Period during Indira Gandhi regime is often regarded as dark days of Indian Democracy. But what was the actual reason behind Indira Gandhi proclaiming the emergency of 1975? In this mini-documentary, I go in depth to explain the root causes and reasons behind it. Starting from 1969 and the infamous battle between the legislative and judiciary to pass the privy purse laws and the nationalisation of banks laws.

What if India has 0% Income Tax? | Dhruv Rathee,"The abolition of Income tax is an idea which appeals to a lot of Indians. It may not be as unrealistic as it sounds since BJP’s own Subramaniam Swamy is an active proponent of this. This is also a reality in many countries across the world. As many as 23 countries like UAE, Bermuda, Panama, Monaco don’t have a personal income tax in their countries. Some don’t even have corporate tax. How do these countries manage to earn revenue? What are the sources of income for their governments? I explain this hypothetical scenario and how India could potentially make zero income tax.

Petrol Price Rise | What are Oil Bonds? | Dhruv Rathee,"The petrol price rise happening all across India has made the petrol and diesel prices record high for the average consumer. The price is touching ₹107 to ₹110 per liter in some cities. The Modi Govt has come up with a new justification for all this - Oil Bonds repayment from Congress times. So what are oil bonds? And how much are they responsible for the rise in petrol and diesel and fuel prices? I explain in this video.

Reality of Savarkar and Subash Chandra Bose | Partition 1947 | Dhruv Rathee,"This video explores Indian history between 1920 to 1947 from the eyes of partitionists. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, a key figure in our story was arrested by British and sent to kala paani. He is controversial for writing mercy petitions and a book on Hindutva. A political ideology based on religious divide and racism. On the other hand, this video talks about muslim nationalism too involving Rahmat Ali and Jinnah. How did the two nation theory come into being? What role did nationalists like Gandhi, Khan abdul gaffar khan, subhash chandra bose, bhagat singh play in this situation? What were Jinnah's letters to Churchill? And what was the Cabinet mission plan which would fragment india in several parts? Learn about the partition in this video.

Earlier socialism was defined as an economic system based on social interest. Rousseau and Proudhon argued for elimination of private property. Charles Fourier, Robert Owen advocated Utopian socialism, i.e. rich people be given moral values and they should share their wealth. Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda were inspired by such ideas. Karl Marx defined socialism as - from each as per his ability, to each as per his contribution. He saw it as an intermediate stage between capitalism and communism. Bhagat Singh was proponent of this revolutionary socialism. Fabian socialism was an ideology of Fabian society which talked about brining socialism through gradual reformist democratic measures. Jawahar Lal Nehru was a fabian socialist. Cooperative socialism implies socialization of means of production. John Meynard Keynes advocated that the government should organize and regulate the economic system, huge government spending so as to control recession, inequality, monopoly. In this video, I explain all such types of socialism.

World's Most Expensive Currency | Dhruv Rathee,"What if I asked you which is the world’s most expensive currency? Considering that there are only a handful of so-called major currencies in the world, your guesses would include the US Dollar, Euro, Pound or even the Japanese Yen. However, the correct answer would be- The Kuwaiti Dinar or the KWD(its denomination). At the time of shooting this video, 1 Kuwaiti Dinar equals almost 250 Rupees! Why is that the case? How did the Kuwaiti Dinar become so valuable that it has outperformed even the USD (which makes up 60% of the forex reserves in the central banks across the world even today!)? And how does cryptocurrency like Bitcoin fit in terms of valuableness? I explain in today’s video.

In this video, I explain the sequence of events which led to the fall of Kabul and the chaos that happened at the Kabul Airport. The president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani has now fled the country and went to either Uzbekistan or Tajikistan. Countries like China and Russia are ready to accept the new Taliban govt while western countries like UK and USA would probably not. I also explain the international geopolitics in this scenario.

Partition 1947 । Why it happened? | India and Pakistan | Dhruv Rathee,"India’s Independence Day on 15th August 1947 was a landmark moment of happiness for millions. But the dark side of the moment was the Partition of country into India and Pakistan by Mountbatten Plan. What was the cause of this partition? Who caused the partition of 1947? Our story actually starts earlier than you might think. British started playing the policy of Divide and Rule after 1857 revolt shook the company rule. Pro-british Syed Ahmed Khan gave the two-nation theory in 1887 saying that the Hindus and Muslims are two different nations. I explain the role of Jinnah and the events till 1920s in this mini documentary.

Recently France based organization Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International laid their hands on a leaked list of 50000 phone numbers, which were targets or potential targets of snooping by Pegasus, which is a spyware built by Israel company NSO group. These revelations were made open to the world by 17 media organizations in 10 countries, like The Guardian, The Washington Post, Le Monde and Indian news portal The Wire. The list included 300 Indians - politicians like Rahul Gandhi, Abhishek Banerjee, Prashant Kishore, many activists and journalists like Rohini Singh, Vijaita Singh. BJP-headed Indian government has denied allegations of snooping. Herein I explain this issue of the Pegasus Project.

How Credit Cards Work? Should I own a Credit Card? | Dhruv Rathee,"Credit cards have become an important part of our financial transactions today. They can help us pay for things when we don’t have money to buy them immediately. They give us the liberty to pay for things later. But is it always a win-win situation for us as far as credit cards are concerned? How do credit cards work? And how do the issuers of credit cards, who pay on our behalf, earn profit from them? Also, what are the things that you should keep in mind while getting a credit card?

Extreme Heatwave in Canada | 50°C Temperature | Climate Change | Dhruv Rathee,"As unbelievable as it sounds, a village for lytton in the state of British Columbia in Canada registered a record breaking temperature of almost 50°C last week. The fact that this comes as a big surprise is because Canada is one of the coldest countries on planet. Experts blame a heat dome as the reason behind this but the real cause is climate change. I explain how the extreme weather patterns are increasing in all parts of the world because of this, which means summers will become hotter and winters will become colder. And what can we do to stop the climate change?

Lakshadweep in Danger | What is happening? | Praful Patel | Dhruv Rathee,"Lakshadweep islands are India's smallest union territory but they encompass a huge amount of biodiversity and wildlife in them. So much so that Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep islands are the only places in India which are classified as HOPE spots. They are also the place with the lowest crime rate and one of the highest literacy rates in India. Everything was peaceful until a new Lakshadweep administrator Praful K Patel was appointed by the President and things went bad. What exactly were the decisions that he took? I explain in this video along with the administrative structure of Lakshadweep.

Israel Palestine Conflict: 1000 year History | Jerusalem | Gaza | West Bank |  Dhruv Rathee,"How was the country of Israel born? When did Palestine came into being? In this video, I explain in detail the complete history of Israel - Palestine conflict which dates back to before the Ottoman empire. In 1917, the British promised Jews a separate country in the Balfour declaration. In 1947, the United Nations released a partition plan after which Israel first came into existence and immediately went to war in 1948 with the neighbouring Arab countries. Why did Israel and Palestine came so close to achieving peace in 1993? From the year 1000s to year 2021, this video takes you through the complete history of the region.

You might be forced to do COVID-19 treatment at home for your family / relatives who are suffering from Coronavirus. In this video, I explain the step by step procedure of home isolation treatment for COVID-19. Which steroids can you use for treatment and which ones like Remdesivir to avoid? What are the most effective techniques to increase your oxygen saturation?

All the information in this video has been compiled by a team of professional doctors based in Vellore. I still highly recommend that you consult a doctor / nurse at least once before implementing the techniques mentioned in this video since your previous health conditions may cause undesired side effects from some steroids. Although this information is up to date with the best of current knowledge, apply this in your home at your own risk.

Arnab Goswami WhatsApp Chat Leak | Explained by Dhruv Rathee,"In a massive leak, the WhatsApp chats of Arnab Goswami with Ex-CEO of BARC Partho Dasgupta have been allegedly leaked on social media. I explain the possible source of these leaks and the content of the chats which concern the nation and government. According to The Hindu, these 500 pages of WhatsApp chat leaks are from the 3400 page chargesheet that the Mumbai Police filed in the TRP Scam investigation. What is truly surprising is the extent of corruption, brokering it reveals between the media and the government.

India may soon be getting a new Parliament building if the Modi govt gets it way. But what is the need for building a whole new parliament?

How Farmers Bills passed Rajya Sabha! | Dhruv Rathee,"On September 20th, Rajya Sabha passed the controversial farmers bills. But the way it was done raises serious questions about the functioning of Indian Parliamentary Democracy. The speaker did a voice vote when many Rajya Sabha Members were raising constantly demanding a division vote. I explain in this video what voice vote, division vote is and what happened on the day. Many MPs including Derek O Brien and Sanjay Singh were suspended from the Rajya Sabha after this. With opposition boycotting the Raja Sabha, the govt went on to pas 15 bills without any consensus in the past 2 days.

Lebanon Crisis: Entire Govt Resigns | Explained by Dhruv Rathee,"The country of Lebanon has a very unique political system owing to its religious demographics which make up approximately 27% Sunni Muslims, 27% Shia Muslims and 21% Maronite Christians. The rule is such that the president of the country always has to be a Maronite Christian, the speaker of the parliament must always be a Shia Muslim and the Prime Minister must be a Sunni Muslim. This sectarian devision has caused a lot of conflicts in the country and eventually plunged the country into unprecedented economic crisis.

Why Assam Floods Every Year? | Assam Floods 2022 | Dhruv Rathee,"Year after year it is the same story. Millions of people get displaced in Assam and other north east indian states due to floods, precious human and animal lives are lost. In this video, I analyse the reason behind why these Assam floods happen. Since 1950, there have been 12 major floods, but in recent years the frequency of the floods have increased drastically. Deforestation in the Brahmaputra area, encroachment of floodplains, location of Assam, poor maintenance of embankments and climate change are a few of the reasons. I will specially focus on climate change and embankments in this video. Embankments are also called Levee or Dykes. I explain what they are, the problem with them and the solutions while talking up the Netherlands as a case study.

Gunjan Saxena: Reality of Women in Armies | Dhruv Rathee | Netflix India,"In this video, I show you the real story behind Air Force Pilot Gunjan Saxena, her heroics and the role she played in bringing gender equality in the Indian armed forces. I talk about her childhood and the brave missions she carried out during the battle.  I also look at the role played by women in the Indian Armed Forces and try to answer the following questions: 
Why have women been continuously marginalised in the Indian Armed Forces? Why were women officers not eligible for a permanent job or pension until recently? What was the government’s position on this matter?  And, what is the role of women in the armed forces across the world?

Was Vikas Dubey Encounter Fake? | Dhruv Rathee,"With a history of criminal records, Vikas Dubey was recently arrested by Uttar Pradesh Police. Allegedly he tried to escape and was encountered. Same story repeated with other members of his gang. Prabhat Mishra, Abhay Dubey and others. Social media users have alleged that this is a fake encounter by the police and a clear cut case of extra judicial justice. I explain in this video his history and the evidences we have. And also explain the role of our third pillar of judiciary, the root causes behind the problems we face and why encounter is not the solution.

India vs China Border | Explained by Dhruv Rathee,"Has China really intruded into the Indian Territory in Ladakh? The answer depends on which country's political map do you use and whose claim do you consider. There are conflicting reports by various experts on this because the Indian Govt has not officially released any statement on it. In this video, I report what various retired army officers have been saying from their sources and interview retired colonel Ajai Shukla for his opinion on this current India-China border dispute. The current issue is happening at three different places- Pangong lake in Ladakh, Galwan river valley and hot springs near kongka pass. I also explain the basics of LOC (Line of control) and LAC (Line of actual control) and the different claim lines of India and China in this video.

Locust Attack in India | Explained by Dhruv Rathee,"Since December Locust swarms have been destroying crops all over East Africa and now they have reached Pakistan and India. Locusts are insects which belong to the same family as crickets and grasshoppers. They grow in isolation (solitary phase) but lack of rain can push individual locusts to grow. And in high densities, they undergo a phase change to the gregarious phase. This changes their habits, behavior, appearance and causes swarms to build up, which destroy agriculture crops across the world. In this video, I explain these details about locusts, their swarms and solutions to fight against them.

Because of this, all across the world, we are seeing cases where Bats are being harassed, blamed and exterminated out of fear that they can cause the infection. In this video, I interview a Chiropterologist - Rohit Chakravarty (a person who is researching specially on Bats) to clear all doubts regarding bats. Answering questions like Can Bats spread Coronavirus? Do you have to be scared of them? How dangerous are they?

The Problem with Arnab Goswami | Opinion by Dhruv Rathee,"Arnab Goswami recently got into a controversy after his latest debate on his 9pm show. After which he had FIRs being filed against him and on 27th April, he was questioned by the Mumbai Police for over 12 hours. His supporters say that he is being targeted for speaking against Sonia Gandhi and this is against freedom of speech. His critics say that he deserves this. In this video, I present my opinion on Arnab Goswami, his channel Republic TV and this current issue of freedom of speech. Is his freedom of speech really being violated or should it be considered as hate speech? 

According to DangerousSpeech.org website, there's 5 things that are important to consider when drawing the line between free speech
1. Speaker: Did the message come from influential speaker?
2. Audience: Are the listeners already fearful so they are more suspectful?
3. Message: What kind of elements does the message carry?
4. Context: Is there any historical or social context which makes division more likely?
5. Medium: How influential is the medium? Is it the primary source of news for that audience?

Saudi-Russia Oil Price Crash | Explained by Dhruv Rathee,"In the past few weeks, Oil Prices have crashed from around $60 a barrel down to almost $20 a barrel. This is not only a big deal for global economy, geopolitics but also environment. Almost every country’s economy is affected by this, either positively or negatively. The big reason for this is the falling global demand and the oil price war between Russia, USA and Saudi Arabia. The three biggest producers of Oil. Saudi Arabia is a part of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) which together control the supply of oil to regulate the price in the market. Russia did an agreement with Saudi which was popularly known as OPEC+ but the talks broke down after Russia refused to decrease the supply of oil. This will impact the US Shale Oil businesses which may go bankrupt. It is a big profit for oil importing countries like India and Japan which will save them billions of dollars.

India's Best Statue | Ground Report by Dhruv Rathee,"In this ground report from Trivandrum, Kerala, I visit the Jatayu Earth Center. Undoubtedly the Best Statue in India and perhaps the best tourist place in India which has been recently made. You will see what makes this tourist place so unique and special in this video. It is 100% privately funded at a cost of ₹100 crores only by multiple NRI investors. It is made on a BOT - Build, Operate, Transfer model according to which the tourist site will be given to government after 30 years. Apart from this unique business model, this is also an eco-tourism site. I interview its sculptor Rajiv Anchal in this video.

"Inside World's Smallest ""Country"" | Ground Report by Dhruv Rathee","In this ground report, I explore the most unique country in the world. Located inside Australia, Principality of Hutt River is a country with a population of only 23 people. It was founded by just one person (Leonard Casley) after disagreements with the Australian government and his own family is the only one that lives there. I interview his son to ask about the legitimacy of a nation. It will make you question the concept of a nation and how it is defined!

Reality of Chandrayaan 2 Moon Mission | Explained by Dhruv Rathee,"Yesterday was the 50th anniversary of humanity's moon landing, the day on which Neil Armstrong became the first human to step on the moon. Today, India is launching the historic Chandrayaan 2 mission which will make India only the fourth country to have landed on the moon and the first in the space race to reach the south pole. In this video, i explain why south pole is so important and how the search for water on moon has progressed in the past decade. Water exists in the form of ice in the shadowed region of craters on the moon.

Attention: There are two factual errors in the video as follows- 
1. The lander's touchdown date is September 6/7, not September 19
2. Gaganyaan does not aim to send humans to the Moon. It's only about launching an Indian crew to low-Earth orbit for seven days. ISRO has not announced any plans yet to send humans to the Moon.

Reality of Modi's Varanasi after 5 years | Ground Report by Dhruv Rathee,"After 5 years of Modi's rule, how has Varanasi changed? Is it more cleaner? Has the Vikas finally reached here? I go on ground in this 20 min documentary to investigate and show you the reality. I will show you people's opinions, cleaning of ghats, cleaning of Ganga, the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor and Modi's adopted village. A few kilometres from Varanasi lies the Model Village of Jayapur. It was adopted by Narendra Modi in 2014 under the Saansad Adarsh Gaon Yojna. The condition is shocking to say the least. Roads, Schools, Drainage, Toilets, Solar Panels are all in a bad shape. Health care centres / Hospitals, skill centres, schools above class 5 are completely missing. Ironically, this village was also adopted by RSS in 2002 under the ideal village scheme.

BJP vs Congress: Which Manifesto is Better? | Analysis by Dhruv Rathee,"I review and analyse the BJP manifesto for 2019 lok sabha elections. Then, I compare it to the Congress Manifesto to judge which is better for India. The whole document is 44 page long with multiple promises being made. But I will only talk about the promises which are specifically stated, easy to measure or have a given deadline. I divided the different promises in the manifesto in four different categories, based on how easy or difficult is it to implement them and how much we need them, for long term development of India. Here are the four different categories

1:28 Most needed promises that are easy to implement
2:35 Most needed promises that are difficult to implement 
4:34 Improbable promises 
7:02 Unclear / Bad Promises
8:24 Which manifesto is better?

Should Voting be Compulsory? | Analysis by Dhruv Rathee,"Everyone has the right to vote in our country. But what would happen if this right to vote became a duty and it became compulsory to vote? You will be surprised to know that this is how it works across many countries in the world! I analyze the different countries across the world, where right to vote started, how it was selective at first and later, how it is compulsory in some. Get a world wide view of voting across democracies!

BJP Leaks: Breaking Democracy across India! | Bebak Ep.5 with Abhisar Sharma,"Abhisar Sharma shows how the corrupt system forgives BJP for anything and everything nowadays. In Karnataka, operation lotus is trying to make the Karnataka govt fall for the 7th time as Yedyurappa's audio leaks show. Another video of BJP leader surfaces where he tells that Modi and Shah have the court in their control and they can make the M.P. govt fall. In Bengal, BJP leader is openly caught asking CBI to pressurise IPS officers in yet another audio leak. Ironically, even with so many leaks available and people being caught red handed, mainstream media is ignoring these issues.

Reality of 10% Reservation for Economically Weak: New Jumla? | Opinion by Dhruv Rathee,"Union cabinet on Monday approved 10% reservation in jobs and educational institutions for economically weak sections in general category. This will be given over and above the existing 50% reservation. In this video, I will tell you why I think this new scheme is nothing but a Jumla and a Lollipop to appease voters. The data suggests that more than 90% of general category people are eligible for being ‘Economically weak” and poor according to new criterion (based on my assumptions). So the question arises here, will the real poor people even benefit from this? What is the point of this new reservation? Ironically, people sill have to pay income tax despite being eligible under this category.

2.0 - Science behind Rajnikanth 's Movie | Mobile Phone Radiation Explained by Dhruv Rathee,"Rajnikanth and Akshay Kumar's Robot 2.0 movie has become a big blockbuster. This movie is built around the theme of cellphone tower and mobile phone radiation impacting the population of birds in India. In this video, I will explore the scientific accuracy of this claim. Do cellphone towers emit radiation? If yes, how harmful is it to birds and humans? Should we stop using our smartphones and cellphones? I explain the concept of Electromagnetic waves, ionising and non-ionising radiation and wildlife and bird conservation.

Vijay Mallya: Who helped him Escape? | Analysis by Dhruv Rathee,"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley met Vijay Mallya before leaving India according to them. This one statement has revealed many hidden details and secrets in this case and raised some very important questions. But this controversy became one more issue where BJP and Congress have started blaming each other.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee: Best PM of India? | Analysis by Dhruv Rathee,"Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is no more. In this video, I do an analysis of the achievements of his government from 1999 - 2004. The milestones that India achieved under him are impressive to say the least, which is why it not an understatement to put Atal Bihari Vajpayee under one of the best PMs (Prime Ministers) India has ever seen. The main focus of this video is five areas - Education, Science, Foreign Policy, Economy and Infrastructure and his Personality. Please keep in mind that this is only an analysis of the achievements and positive points of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but obviously he had many negatives also. You can see that in Vinod Dua ji's video.

Photoshopped Videos created using Artificial Intelligence!! | Explained by Dhruv Rathee,"We have reached a point in technology, where it is possible to create anything, make anyone say anything in a high resolution video. Till now, this was done in movies using long and complicated process of CGI.

He has started India's greatest fact checking website called Alt News, also starting a alternative media revolution. I do a casual interview with him while sitting outside in the wind. I hope you don't mind the quality of the video, it is not that good because we did not have any proper equipment to film this.
More videos on this event will come soon :)

Truth behind PayTM by Dhruv Rathee | Cobrapost Operation 136,"The latest cobrapost sting operation has revealed the reality of PayTM app and it's senior vice president Ajay Shekhar. In the video, Ajay openly tells how he sold off the data to the prime minister's office after receiving a single personal phone call. This raises questions on the data management of the PayTM app and if they really care about the data privacy of their customers. I also talk about the response of the PayTM to this whole issue and critically analyse it.
